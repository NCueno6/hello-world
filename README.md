greetings & salutations, I have zero clues about coding but our 14yo is into it and I'm out of work. Why not? We'll see how far I get... More about me? Cookies, I heart cookies harder than Cookie Monster (which our 2yo can say. of course.). I heart other things hard, the 14yo, 2yo and an 11yo are a few, but mostly cookies.
